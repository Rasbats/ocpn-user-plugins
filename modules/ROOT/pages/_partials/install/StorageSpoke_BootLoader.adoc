==== Boot Loader Installation

{PRODUCT} uses [application]*GRUB2* (GRand Unified Bootloader version 2) as its boot loader. The boot loader is the first program that runs when the computer starts and is responsible for loading and transferring control to an operating system. [application]*GRUB2* can boot any compatible operating system (including Microsoft Windows) and can also use chain loading to transfer control to other boot loaders for unsupported operating systems.

[WARNING]
====

Installing [application]*GRUB2* may overwrite your existing boot loader.

====

If you have other operating systems already installed, the {PRODUCT} installer will attempt to automatically detect and configure the boot loader to start them. You can manually configure any additional operating systems after you finish the installation, if they are not detected properly. For instructions on editing [application]*GRUB2* configuration, see the [citetitle]_{PRODUCT} System{nbsp}Administrator's{nbsp}Guide_, available at link:++https://docs.fedoraproject.org/++[]

If you are installing Fedora system with more than one disk, you may want to manually specify where the bootloader should be installed. Click the `Full disk summary and bootloader` link at the bottom of the `Installation Destination` screen. The `Selected Disks` dialog will appear. The bootloader will be installed on the device of your choice, or on a UEFI system, the `EFI system partition` will be created on that device during guided partitioning.

.Boot Device Selection

In the `Boot` column, a "tick" icon marks one of the devices as the intended boot device. To change the boot device, select a device from the list and click the `Set as Boot Device` button to install the boot loader there instead. Only one device can be set as the boot device.

To decline installation of a new boot loader, select the device currently marked for boot and click the `Do not install bootloader` button. This will remove the tick and ensure [application]*GRUB2* is not installed on any device.

[WARNING]
====

If you choose not to install a boot loader for any reason, you will not be able to boot the system directly, and you must use another boot method, such as a stand-alone commercial boot loader application. Use this option only if you are sure you have another way to boot your system.

====

The boot loader may also require a special partition to be created, depending on whether your system uses BIOS or UEFI firmware and also depending on whether the boot drive has a _GUID Partition Table_ (GPT) or a `Master Boot Record` (MBR, also known as msdos) label. If you use automatic partitioning, the installer will create this partition if needed. For details, see xref:Installing_Using_Anaconda.adoc#sect-installation-gui-manual-partitioning-recommended[Recommended Partitioning Scheme].
