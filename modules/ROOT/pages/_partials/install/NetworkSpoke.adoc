=== Network & Hostname

The `Network & Hostname` screen is used to configure network interfaces. Options selected here will be available both during the installation (if needed for tasks such as downloading packages from a remote location) and on the installed system.

[NOTE]
====

Network configuration is an expansive topic and many of the options available during the installation are beyond the scope of this document. For detailed information about networking, including both theoretical topics and specific instructions and examples, see the [citetitle]_{PRODUCT} Networking{nbsp}Guide_, available at link:++https://docs.fedoraproject.org/++[].

.Network & Hostname

image::anaconda/NetworkSpoke.png[The Network & Hostname screen. In the left pane, one physical interface and one custom VLAN interface is shown; the right side shows details of the currently selected interface. System hostname is configured at the bottom.]

Locally accessible interfaces are automatically detected by the installation program and cannot be manually added or deleted. All detected interfaces are listed on the left side of the screen. Click an interface in the list to display its current configuration (such as IP and DNS address); the details are displayed on the right side of the screen.

Below the list of interfaces are two buttons. Use the `+` button to add a virtual network interface (Team, Bond or VLAN) as described in xref:install/Installing_Using_Anaconda.adoc#sect-installation-gui-network-configuration-virtual-interface[Adding a Virtual Network Interface]. To remove a previously created virtual interface, select it in the list and click the `-` button.

To change settings such as IP addresses, DNS servers, or routing configuration for an existing interface (both virtual and physical), select the interface in the left pane and click `Configure` in the bottom right corner of the screen. Available settings are described in xref:install/Installing_Using_Anaconda.adoc#sect-installation-gui-network-configuration-advanced[Editing Network Interface Configuration].

Use the `ON`pass:attributes[{blank}]/pass:attributes[{blank}]`OFF` switch in the top right corner to enable or disable the currently selected interface.

Below the list of connections, enter a host name for this computer in the `Hostname` input field. The host name can be either a _fully-qualified domain name_ (FQDN) in the format _hostname_._domainname_, or a short host name with no domain name. Many networks have a _Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol_ (`DHCP`) service that automatically supplies connected systems with a domain name; to allow the `DHCP` service to assign the domain name to this machine, only specify the short host name.
