= Preparing for Installation

This chapter describes the steps you need take before you begin the installation. Not every step must be strictly followed - for example, if you plan to use the default installation settings, you do not need to gather system information such as disk device labels/UUIDs or network information such as the system's IP address. However, you should still go through this chapter, as it also describes the available types of installation media and how to prepare boot media and installation sources.

[[sect-preparing-upgrade-or-install]]
== Upgrade or Install?

If you already have Fedora installed and want to upgrade your installation to the current version, there are two basic ways to do so:

Automatic upgrade using [application]*dnf system upgrade*::  The preferred way to upgrade your system is an automatic upgrade using the [application]*dnf system upgrade* utility. For information on performing an automatic upgrade, see link:++https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/DNF_system_upgrade++[Fedora Wiki dnf system upgrade].

Manual Reinstallation::  You can upgrade to the latest version of Fedora manually instead of relying on [application]*dnf system upgrade*. This involves booting the installer as if you were performing a clean installation, letting it detect your existing Fedora system, and overwriting the root partition while preserving data on other partitions and volumes. The same process can also be used to reinstall the system, if you need to. For detailed information, see xref:advanced/Upgrading_Your_Current_System.adoc#sect-upgrading-fedora-manual-reinstall[Manual System Upgrade or Reinstallation].

[WARNING]
====
Always back up your data before performing an upgrade or reinstalling your system, no matter which method you choose.

[[sect-preparing-boot-media]]
== Preparing Boot Media

Fedora images are `Hybrid ISOs` and can be used to create installation media with both optical and USB disks, for booting on both BIOS and UEFI systems.

=== Fedora Media Writer

[application]*Fedora Media Writer* has been significantly improved and is now the official, tested and supported way to make bootable media. [application]*Fedora Media Writer* supports Linux, Mac, and Windows. It is an easy way to make
bootable USB media to install Fedora (or other operating systems). Using [application]*Fedora Media Writer* is strongly encouraged, although other USB media creation software can work as well.

Some of the new additions to [application]*Fedora Media Writer* are that Fedora Workstation and Server are easily and quickly accessible from the selection on the main screen. Further choices are available if you select the button below _Custom image_. This offers a selection of various Fedora Spins, such as Xfce or Mate.

Historically, universal USB creation tools, such as [application]*Unetbootin*, are a popular way to create USB installers from ISOs intended for optical media. They typically create a filesystem on the USB drive by extracting files from the image, and writing [application]*syslinux* bootloader to the device.

These methods circumvent the boot-loader configuration built into Fedora images, which are pre-partitioned and designed to boot on UEFI systems with SecureBoot enabled as well as BIOS systems, and thus they do not produce consistent results with Fedora images, especially on UEFI systems.

The best results are produced by utilities that use a direct write method and do not modify the Fedora image.

[WARNING]
====
Always think twice before writing an image to the device. The media creation methods described in this article are destructive.
All data on the USB stick are deleted during the process, so make sure you have a back up of the data on the USB stick. Double check that you have selected correct device to write the image to!

=== Other methods to create a live USB

Using the *Fedora Media Writer* is highly recommended for everybody, because it offers a reliable way to create a live USB stick for Fedora installation.

However, some experienced users may prefer to go through the creation process manually. If you decide to do so, you have to download the installation images and use an application to write them onto the USB stick.

[NOTE]
====
If you have downloaded and verified the installation images manually, you still can write them onto the USB stick using *Fedora Media Writer*.
====


[[sect-preparing-obtaining-images]]
==== Downloading Boot and Installation Images

The Fedora Project offers different Editions tailored for some specific use cases. Choose the Fedora Edition best for you, or you can build your own by customizing after the installation, or by using a kickstart file as described in xref:advanced/Kickstart_Installations.adoc#sect-kickstart-file-create[Creating a Kickstart File]. Kickstart installation requires the `netinstall` media type, or a direct installation booting method such as PXE; kickstarts are not supported with live images.

Read more about Fedora Workstation, Fedora Cloud, Fedora Server and the available media types in xref:Downloading_Fedora.adoc#chap-downloading-fedora[Downloading Fedora].

You can also choose a Fedora _Spin_ featuring favorite alternative desktops or tools for specialized tasks at link:++https://spins.fedoraproject.org++[].

[[sect-verifying-images]]
==== Verifying the Downloaded Image

Because transmission errors or other problems may corrupt the Fedora image you have downloaded, it is important to verify the file's integrity. After the images are created, an operation is performed on the file that produces a value called a `checksum` using a complex mathematical algorithm. The operation is sufficiently complex that *any change* to the original file will produce a different checksum.

By calculating the image's `checksum` on your own computer and comparing it to the original `checksum`, you can verify the image has not been tampered with or corrupted. The original checksum values are provided at link:++https://getfedora.org/security/++[], and are [command]#gpg# signed to demonstrate their integrity.

[[sect-verifying-windows]]
==== Verifying checksums on Windows systems

. Download the Fedora image of your choice from link:++https://fedoraproject.org/get-fedora++[] and the corresponding checksum file from link:++https://getfedora.org/security/++[]

=== Creating a Boot CD or DVD
In addition to creating a bootable USB flash drive, you can also use the provided ISO images to create bootable optical media (a CD or DVD). This approach may be necessary when installing {PRODUCT} on an older system which can not boot from USB.

[NOTE]
====

The exact steps you need to take to burn a bootable CD or DVD from an ISO image will vary depending on what disc burning software you use. This procedure only offers a general overview.

====

. Insert a blank CD or DVD into your system's CD or DVD burner.

. Open your system's burning software - for example, [application]*Brasero* on {PRODUCT} systems with [application]*GNOME* desktop environment, or [application]*Nero* on Windows systems. In the software's main menu, find an option which lets you burn an ISO image to a disc. For example, in [application]*Brasero*, this option is `Burn image` in the main menu on the left side of the window.

. When prompted, select the ISO image of {PRODUCT} to be burned, and the CD or DVD burner with a blank disc inside (if you have more than one drive).

. Confirm your selection, and wait for the disc to be burned.
